This is a simple React app to view and add recipes. It is intended to be used as a Chrome extension.

[See a live demo](https://polite-syrniki-d5be52.netlify.app/). Note: Site probably won't work due to CORS. Use a CORS unblocker extension to get around this.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser to the specified port in the console (e.g. `http://localhost:5174`)

## Install the Chrome Extension

This project includes a `manifest.json` which allows the app to be installed as a Chrome extension. To install it:

1. Follow the installation instructions above.
2. Run `npm run build`.
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the `dist` directory in this project, generated by the build step.
5. The extension should now be installed. You can click the icon in the toolbar to open the app.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) as the UI framework.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool, probably my favorite build tool for React apps right now if not using a metaframework like Next.js or Remix.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. Lots of arbitrary values since multiple colors where used in the original design.
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) for some of the UI components (specifically the Combobox).
- [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/) for async state management.
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form management. Probably a bit overkill for just a simple form, but it's fast and easy to use.
